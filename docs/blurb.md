The Malaria Elimination Case Surveillance & Foci Investigation package supports the [Global technical strategy for malaria](https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789240031357) of transforming surveillance into a core intervention for malaria elimination. The tracker packages supporting case notification, case investigation, foci investigation and classification workflows are designed to be used in conjunction with the aggregate DHIS2 packages for malaria programme monitoring in elimination and burden reduction settings to strengthen data quality, analysis and data-driven decision making.

The package includes two tracker programs intended to work together:
Malaria Case Notification, Investigation & Response program
Malaria Foci Investigation program

The data elements and attributes included follow WHO-recommendations based on global standards and normative guidance as stipulated in the organisations guidelines and guiding documents; in particular, [Malaria Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation: A reference manual](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565578)
